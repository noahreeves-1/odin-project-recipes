        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This dish is a classic meal that is simple to make, well-rounded, and always
                a crowd pleaser. It only has a few ingredients and can be a quick meal if the rice is 
                already ready.
            </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>chicken breast</li>
                <li>rice (white or brown)</li>
                <li>broccoli</li>
                <li>teriyaki sauce (store-bought)</li>
                <li>sesame seeds</li>
                <li>salt</li>
                <li>pepper</li>
                <li>red pepper flakes</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>rinse the rice in water two or three times until water is clear</li>
                <li>start rice cooker or turn on fire</li>
                <li>season the chicken with your choice of seasoning, but in this case,
                    we will go with the classic salt & pepper.</li>
                <li>using a pan with a lid, heat the pan until hot</li>
                <li>pour some canola oil and once hot, place the chicken breasts on the hot pan</li>
                <li>don't touch the chicken and let it cook for 3-4 minutes</li>
                <li>flip the clicken and place the lid on the pan and let it cook for another 3-4 minutes</li>
                <li>check the temperature of the chicken. If it is not at least 165 degrees Farenheit
                    continue to cook the chicken.</li>
                <li>Once the chicken is done, let it side aside while you cook the broccoli.</li>
                <li>Clean the pan or use another pan with a lid and heat using a medium heat.</li>
                <li>Once hot, pour some canola oil in the pan. Once the oil is hot, place the clean 
                    broccolis in the pan and season with salt and paper. Make sure to also get
                    one or two ounces of water and place it in the pan before covering it with
                    the lid.</li>
                <li>The broccoli should be done in 3-6 minutes depending on how much you like
                    your broccolis cooked. Slice the chicken into your desired shap while
                    the broccoli is cooking.</li>
                <li>Once the broccoli is done to your liking, take it out of the pan.</li>
                <li>The rice should be finished or nearly finished by now. Put rice in a bowl,
                    then the sliced chicken, then the broccolis, and pour teriyaki sauce over
                    the food.</li>
                <li>Most importantly, enjoy.</li>
