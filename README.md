# odin-recipes

This is the first project assigned to me by The Odin Project. I will be building a basic recipe
website.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The website
won't look very pretty by the time you've finished.

The focus will mainly be on HTML and maybe some basic CSS.
